# GenreSurf
A fluid, user-controlled means of discovering music.

There are two primary intentions that I have with this project.

1. I want to allow the user to intuitively explore the hierarchy of genres of recorded music as set forward in RateYourMusic.com's databases. They have a very comprehensive organization of this domain that is based on user votes.

2. I want to allow the user to discover music at whatever level of this hierarchy that they wish while allowing them complete control over a very important metric that is often completely hidden to the user. I'll describe this metric as being the balance between a chart sorted purely by popularity and a chart sorted purely by high ratings (whether they be for an album, single, EP, etc.). "Best of" chart websites typically decide this value somewhat arbitrarily. The only control that RYM currently gives the user in this regard is the option between their "normal" charts and "obscure" charts (obscure meaning that such a chart would give higher priority to pure ratings vs. popularity). I have always wanted to see a chart that resorts itself live according to a slider moving along a spectrum between the two pure concerns.

I will also look into providing integration with Spotify APIs for this app, so music explorers can set up their queue of essentials that they want to look into.
